My name is Taavi PÃ¤ll.
I work at [University of Tartu](https://www.biomeditsiin.ut.ee/en/institute/department-microbiology), Estonia, and occasionally teach R stats courses: https://github.com/rstats-tln and https://github.com/rstats-tartu. I have been also teaching [Oncobiology](https://github.com/Onkobioloogia) lecture course at Tallinn University of Techology, Estonia.

I am a longtime [Fall](http://thefall.org) fan and enjoy riding mountain bike.
